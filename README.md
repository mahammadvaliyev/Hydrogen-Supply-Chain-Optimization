This project is about comparative analysis of two control strategies—Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Rule-Based Control (RBC)—for optimizing the operation of a solar-powered hydrogen supply chain. The supply chain consists of renewable electricity input, battery energy storage, hydrogen production via electrolysis, and hydrogen storage and sales. Using a Python-based simulation framework, both strategies are evaluated under identical time-varying conditions of solar availability, electricity pricing, and hydrogen demand.
The MPC strategy leverages forecasted disturbances and rolling-horizon optimization to allocate energy resources in a cost-effective manner while satisfying system constraints. In contrast, the RBC approach applies fixed, heuristic rules and operates reactively without predictive capabilities. Results show that MPC achieves significantly higher cost-efficiency by avoiding expensive grid electricity, aligning production with demand, and maximizing hydrogen utilization. The RBC system, although simpler, suffers from overproduction, high energy waste, and severe financial losses due to excessive grid usage. Both strategies show limited battery engagement, indicating a potential area for system design improvement.
Overall, the study highlights the advantages of predictive, optimization-based control for managing hydrogen systems under uncertainty, and lays the foundation for future research in adaptive, data-driven methods such as reinforcement learning.
